//you can do strings in console.log();

//console.log and debugging
//we can debug with console.log messages in 2 big ways:
//1) we can check the status of some javascript 'thing'
//2) we can check a process we have built with repeated console.log messages

//console.log example 1
var sampleName = "Kristen";
console.log(sampleName);

//console.log example 2
var sampleNum = 1;
console.log(sampleNum); // verify that sampleNum is 1
sampleNum++;
console.log(sampleNum); // verify that sampleNum is 2
sampleNum++;
console.log(sampleNum); // verify that sampleNum is 3
